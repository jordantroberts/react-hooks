# Exploring React Hooks

The commit history of this project will show how I explored learning about React Hooks. I started with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React's documentation</a>. After that I wanted to look into fetching data from APIs so I used the <a href="https://api.randomuser.me/">Random User API</a> and displayed a random person's first name and gender each time the user clicks a button.
